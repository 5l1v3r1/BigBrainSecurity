This is the home to a computer forensics/IDS program I'm writing with Apache Spark primarily in Scala. I will 
also use python to develop a plugin for the Volatility Framework and to do some machine learning
prototyping.

NOTE: AnalyzePrefetch.scala will produce innaccurate results for users running Windows 8 or later. The 
list of safe files only includes file names for computers running Windows 7 or earlier. 

See config.txt for details on how to customize the program.
