#
# INSTRUCTIONS: To set custom settings for the program, remove the
# “#” sign from the line and set the parameter to whatever value you wish
# to use. 
# 
# EXAMPLE: “operating_system ~> Windows” is on a line without a “#” sign so
# the computer reads the line and includes it as a part of the program. On the other hand,
# “filter_suspicious ~> false” is preceded by a “#” sign so the value
# “true” is not read by the program. 
# 
# NOTE: ONLY LINES WITHOUT A “#” SIGN are read by the program.
# 
# THE FOLLOWING LINES DICTATE HOW THE PROGRAM OPERATES:
#
# INSTRUCTION: The only three options for the Operating System (OS) are “Mac”, “Windows”, or Windows10
# Note: Choose Windows for all Windows operating systems prior to Windows 7.
operating_system ~> Windows
#
# INSTRUCTION: The following “true” and “false” statements are CASE SENSITIVE:
# 
# MFT FILTER OPTION: Create a numbered index from 0 to the size of the table:
create_integer_index ~> true
# MFT FILTER OPTION: Filter to only include .exe, .jar, .rar, .dll, and .sys extensions.
default_filter ~> true
# MFT FILTER OPTION: NOT SURE WHAT THIS DOES?
fix_timestamp ~> true 
#
# MFT FILTER OPTION: Set the command below to “true” to ONLY include .exe FILES THAT RAN 
# OUTSIDE of System32 AND Program Files:
